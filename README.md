## [⚠️ Be Careful](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans#️-be-careful)

- Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.

- Do not try to force them; bad things are supposed to happen, if done so.

- Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions **to** problems, not solutions **finding** problems; so don't overthink.

- If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior; or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.
